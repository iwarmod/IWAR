###WHAT IS IWAR?

**Irregular Warfare** is an unofficial addon for Arma 3 - Bohemia Interactive which includes **irregular or insurgent forces** (yes, another one) equiped with weapons and vehicles from [RHS Escalation mod](http://www.rhsmods.org) . While there are already other Addons with such content, I decided to create this to suit our needs within **[U.S.M.L. OPs](http://clanusml.net/usmlops.html)**. 

In addition, **IWAR** is **[ALiVE](http://www.alivemod.com) compatible** and so far consists of one faction; however, the idea is to add more as additional content is created within our internal campaigns.


Currently, **IWAR** is in **[alpha phase]** and is available for download through **Play WithSix** and **Steam Workshop** too.
